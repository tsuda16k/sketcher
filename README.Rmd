By using the ```sketcher``` package, you can convert a photo into a line drawing image.  
Drawing style (lineweight and inclusion/exclusion of shadow/shading) can be controlled.  
Some examples (source photos and generated sketches) are shown below.

## Paper

Details of this package are described in the article below:

Tsuda, H. (2020). sketcher: An R package for converting a photo into a sketch style image.  
https://psyarxiv.com/svmw5


## Dependencies

Mac OS X users need to install XQuartz (https://www.xquartz.org/).

## Installation

The package is available on CRAN. It can be installed with:

``` r
install.packages("sketcher")
```

Then, attach the package.

```{r}
library(sketcher)
```

### Installation via GitHub

To install the development version of the ```sketcher``` package via GitHub, you can use the ```devtools``` package.

__NOTE:__  
- On Windows, <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/">Rtools</a> needs to be installed to install a package from GitHub.  
- On Mac, XCode may be needed to be installed to install a package from GitHub.

``` r
devtools::install_github("tsuda16k/sketcher")
```

## Example image

The ```sketcher``` package has a built-in image, which is useful when you want to try sketch effects right away. The image data is named  ```face```.

Internally, this is just a numeric array of size 600 x 460 x 3 [y-coordinate, x-coordinate, color channel]. Each element of the array represents a pixel value, which can range between 0 and 1.

```{r}
dim(face)
```

To plot an image, use the ```plot()``` function.

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
plot(face)
```

<img src="notes/face.png" width="40%">

(In examples below, I actually used <a href="notes/sketcher_face.jpg">this image</a>, which has higher resolution than the image provided by the package. Sketch results will be similar, but in general aesthetically more pleasing results can be obtained with images of higher resolution, at the cost of processing time.)

## Load an image

To load your own image, use the ```im_load()``` function.

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
im = im_load("path/to/your/image.jpg")
plot(im)
```

The jpg, png, and bmp formats are supported.

You can load an image from the web (URL). For example, 

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
im = im_load("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tsuda16k/sketcher/master/notes/sketcher_face.jpg")
```

will load a high resolution version of the face image noted above (compare ```dim(face)``` and ```dim(im)```).

## Apply the sketch effect

The built-in face image is used in the following examples.  
For consistency purposes, the ```face``` image is labeled as ```im```.

```{r}
im = face
```

Use the ```sketch()``` function to apply the sketch effect to an image.

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
im2 = sketch(im) # may take some seconds
plot(im2)
```

<p><img src="notes/sketch.png" width="50%"></p>

That's all.

The ```sketch()``` function has several parameters to control the style of sketch.

## Arguments of the sketch() function

A table of arguments of the ```sketch()``` function:

```{r echo = F, results = 'asis'}
Argument = c("im", "style", "lineweight", "smooth", "gain", "contrast", "shadow", "max.size")
Meaning = c( "An input image", "Sketch style", "Strength of lines",
             "Smoothness of texture", "Gain parameter", "Contrast parameter", "Shadow threshold",
             "Max resolution of output" )
Value = c( "image", "1 or 2", "a numeric, >= 0.3", "an integer, >= 0", "a numeric betw 0 and 1", "a numeric, >= 0",
           "a numeric betw 0 and 1", "an integer, > 0")
Default = c( "", "1", "1", "1", "0.02", "20 (for style1) or 4 (for style2)", "0.0", "2048" )
doc_sketch = data.frame( Argument, Meaning, Value, Default, stringsAsFactors = F )
library(knitr)
kable(doc_sketch)
```

The default is ```sketch(im, style = 1, lineweight = 1, smooth = ceiling(lineweight), gain = .02, contrast = NULL, shadow = 0, max.size = 2048)```.

- im: an image, obtained by using the ```im_load()``` function.
- style: while style 1 focuses on edges, style 2 also retains shading.
- lineweight: as the name suggests. set a numeric value equal to or larger than 0.3.
- smooth: noise/blob smoother. set an integer value equal to or larger than 0.
- gain: this parameter may be useful for noise reduction in dim region.
- contrast: contrast of the sketch image is adjusted by this parameter.
- shadow: if given a value larger than 0 (e.g., 0.3), shadows are added to sketch.
- max.size: the size (image resolution) of output sketch is constrained by this parameter. if the input image has a very high resolution, such as 20000 x 10000 pixels, sketch processing will take a long time. In such cases, the algorithm first downscales the input image to 2048 x 1024 pixels, in this case, and then apply the sketch effect.

The effects of these parameters on sketch appearances are described in detail below.

## Saving the image

Use the ```im_save()``` function to save an image.

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
im = face
im2 = sketch(im, style = 1, lineweight = 1, shadow = 0.3)

# myimage.png is saved in the current working directory
im_save(im2, name = "myimage", path = getwd())

# newimg.jpg is saved to a specified directory
im_save(im2, name = "newimg", path = "set/your/path", format = "jpg", quality = .95)
```

By default, an image is saved in the png format.  
When using ```format = "jpg"```, you can set the quality of jpg compression (default is 0.95).

## The effects of sketch parameters

### - style and lineweight

The most important parameters of the ```sketch()``` function are ```style``` and ```lineweight```.

While style 1 is good at extracting fine edges, style 2 retains shading, as shown in the figure. Note that the shading gets more salient when ```lineweight``` is given a larger value.

### - smooth

The ```smooth``` parameter controls the degree of smoothness of image texture. By increasing the ```smooth``` value, fine-scale edges, noises, and blobs are eliminated (see the figure below). 

In most cases, aesthetically pleasing results will be obtained when ```smooth``` value is equal to or larger than ```lineweight```. If ```smooth``` is not given in the ```sketch()``` function, ```smooth``` is assigned with the same value as ```lineweight``` (actually, ```smooth = ceiling(lineweight)```).

<p><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tsuda16k/sketcher/master/notes/line_smooth_2100.jpg"><img src="notes/line_smooth_1500.jpg" width="100%"></a></p>

### - gain

A constant value (gain) is added to an input image before the extraction of edges to produce a sketch. A sketch can be very noisy when an input image has dark/dim regions. In such cases, increasing the gain, such as ```gain = 0.2``` or ```gain = 0.3```, may reduce the noise. In most cases, however, you don't have to care about this parameter.

### - contrast

By increasing the ```contrast``` parameter, a sketch is darkened. When a sketch appears whitish, you may need to increase the ```contrast``` value.

<p><img src="notes/contrast_900.jpg" width="100%"></p>

### - shadow

Shadow can be added to a sketch by using the ```shadow``` parameter.  
By default, the sketch function does not include shadow (shadow = 0). In many cases, however, adding shadow will be needed to produce a reasonable result (described later).

<p><img src="notes/shadow_900.jpg" width="100%"></p>

## Tips for successful sketching

For some images, good results may be obtained with the default parameters of the sketch function. However, in many cases, the default sketch will produce an unsatisfactory result. Here I show some cases where the default sketch fails, and how to fix it.

### Case 1

Outline is missing and texture is lacking in the default sketch. By using style 2 and adding shadow, ```sketch(im, style = 2, shadow = 0.4)```, the problems are largely solved. In addition, by setting the ```smooth``` parameter to 0, ```sketch(im, style = 2, lineweight = 1, smooth = 0, shadow = 0.4)```, the sketch was successful in representing the fine texture of bird body.

<p><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tsuda16k/sketcher/master/notes/bird_1800.jpg"><img src="notes/bird_1400.jpg" width="100%"></a></p>

### Case 2

Due to the lack of edges in the dark region of the face, the default sketch, ```sketch(im)```, produced a weird result. This can be fixed by adding shadow, such as ```sketch(im, shadow = 0.4)```. Finding the right value of the shadow parameter usually requires trial and error, but usually a value between 0.3 and 0.6 will produce a reasonable result.

<p><img src="notes/face3_900.jpg" width="80%"></p>

### Case 3

The sketch algorithm detects edges in an image. If objects have unclear edges/outlines, sketching will fail. This typically happens when a photo contains 1) out of focus region or 2) objects with unclear outlines such as furry animals.

A cat image below is such an example. The background of the photo and the lower body of the cat is out of focus, and the outline of the cat is blurry. The default sketch, ```sketch(im)```, is unsuccessful in representing the cat body. Zero smoothing, ```sketch(im, smooth = 0)```, can capture hairs/textures of the cat to some extent, at the cost of increased noise in background, and still the body and legs of the cat is not represented well. Unfortunately, there is no simple solution to the difficulty with blurred/defocused images.
